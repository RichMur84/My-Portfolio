    <p>My name is Richard Murillo. I was Born and raised in Long Beach, California, I come from a big family that migrated from Mexico. Growing up with many family members in one household, we didn't have much and struggled to stay afloat. School provided me a much-needed getaway from that busy house full of countless people running around, and in that found that I loved computers that were provided in school. From then, I had a passion of how they worked and all the things they can do. I had a dream of being in the Movie Industry making trailers for movies. I always found that the preview would pump people up to see it even if it was a bad movie, just the music visuals and tone of them would pique interest and sometime deliver a better product that the fact. Thus, life brings obstacles that I couldn't avoid when I was in high school I need to work more to provide for my family and dropped out and been working for a long time until I found web development that my brother-in-law introduced to me and found that itch again. To me, web development is like movie trailers shows a glimpse of things to come you capture their attention with a beautiful and engaging front and show them the magic that happens when they click on a link  to something they want to see or find. I am more than eager to learn and grow in this field and to provide for my self and my ever-growing family.</p>
