        <p class="me">My name is Richard Murillo, I was Born in Long Beach, California and moved to Clearwater, Florida in 2002. I come from a big family that migrated from Mexico, growing up with many family members in one household, we didn't have much and struggled to stay afloat. School provided me a much-needed getaway from that busy household. I loved the computers that were provided in school, From then on I had a passion for how they worked and all the things they can do. I had a dream of being in the Movie Industry making trailers for movies, I always found that the trailer would pump people up to see it even if it was a bad movie. The music, visuals and the tone of the trailers would pique people's interest and draw the viewers in. However, Life brought obstacles that I couldn't avoid when I was in high school, I needed to work more to provide for my family and I dropped out. I had been working for a long time, and then I found web development thanks to my brother-in-law. To me web development is like a movie trailer, it shows a glimpse of things to come, captures the viewer's attention and shows them the magic that happens when they click on a link. I am more than eager to learn and grow in this industry and to provide for myself and my ever-growing family.</p>
